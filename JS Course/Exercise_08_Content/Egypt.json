"Para_1"      : "In the 5th century BC Herodotus wrote of Egypt that \"nowhere are there so many marvellous things...nor in the world besides are to be seen so many things of unspeakable greatness\" - and not too much has changed. The Sphinx, the Nile, ancient Luxor, the pyramids - Egypt's scope is glorious.",
"Para_2"      : "It's not just the Pharaonic monuments that have drawn travellers to this country since long before the birth of Christ - it's the legacy of the Greeks, Romans and early Christians, and the profusion of art and architecture accumulated from centuries of successive Islamic dynasties."
