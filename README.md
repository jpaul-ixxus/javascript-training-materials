JavaScript and jQuery example code snippets - HTML, CSS, JS

The information in this folder contains a number of commonly used functions for both JavaScript and jQuery

There are two main folder, JavaScript and jQuery:

JavaScript

Contains a list of exercise HTML pages containing starter and model answer code for each exercise. Also included is a .css and .js file. There are also three additional folders containing images for three of the exercises (numbered)

jQuery

Contains a number of folders with various examples of common jQuery functions along with respective .css and .js files. Each HTML page references a .css and a .js file (often the same one) and they are not necessarily in the same folder; look for the location of the .css and .js files in the header section of the HTML file to correctly locate the associated files should you wish to view them.

The JS files for the jQuery functions within the jQueryUI folder lists the associated JS that creates the various effects along with Copyright, Release, Links and Depends information.
