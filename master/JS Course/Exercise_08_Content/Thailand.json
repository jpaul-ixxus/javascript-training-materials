"Para_1"      : "The Kingdom of Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia. To its east lie Laos and Cambodia; to its south, the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia; and to its west, the Andaman Sea and Burma. Its capital and largest city is Bangkok.",
"Para_2"      : "The country's official name was Siam until June 24, 1939, and between 1945 and May 11, 1949, when it was changed to Thailand. The word Thai is not, as commonly believed to be, derived from the word Thai meaning 'freedom' in the Thai language; it is, however, the name of an ethnic group from the central plains (the Thai people). With that in mind the locals seemed to have also accepted the alternative meaning and will verbally state that it means 'Land of the free'. This might be due to language barriers and the avoidance of long difficult explanations."
